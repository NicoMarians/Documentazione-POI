South Kensington is also called the "Royal district", Queen Victoria was born in Kensington Palace and in this, the most elegant area of ​​London, you can find the most luxurious homes and the most exclusive streets such as Kensington Road, with its buildings in typical English style, from Georgian to Victorian architecture. In Kensington you can also find Notting Hill, one of the trendiest neighborhoods for a long time. Mayfair is also not only a prestigious area of ​​London but one of the symbolic neighborhoods of London's luxury. Here, in addition to the elegant homes, you can find elegant squares and well kept gardens. These areas were also seen as "safe" areas where you could walk around without worries.

In addition to the East area, the slums extended into central London: they were the St. Giles and Clerkenwell neighborhoods, the “Devil’s Acre” near Westminster Abbey, Jacob’s Island in Bermondsey, along the south bank of the Thames, the Mint in Southwark and Pottery Lane in Notting Hill. The most famous slums in the Victorian era were probably the Whitechapel neighborhoods, where the Jack the Ripper crimes were committed.

The period saw the birth of revolutionary technologies and infrastructure, typified by the construction of iconic railway systems that revolutionized transportation, such as large locomotives and extensive rail networks that connected cities and regions like never before. Among the engineering triumphs of the era were exquisite iron and glass structures, such as the Crystal Palace, designed for the Great Exhibition of 1851, which showcased the ingenuity of Victorian architects and engineers. The era also ushered in the construction of enduring civil engineering works such as Tower Bridge and the vast network of aqueducts, bridges and tunnels that transformed urban environments and facilitated commerce. Furthermore, the development of sanitation systems and public health initiatives illustrated a growing understanding of engineering as a service to society, improving life in densely populated cities. The use of materials such as steel and advances in techniques such as cantilever bridges pushed the boundaries of what was considered possible, marking the Victorian era as a pivotal moment in engineering history that laid the foundation for the modern infrastructure we rely on today.

            It was, in short, the bourgeois (and aristocratic) part of the metropolis, clean, tidy and elegant, home to gentlemen's clubs and social events of the upper class.
            In popular culture, the West End is in direct opposition to the East End, where the former is a symbol of progress and the latter of backwardness.

              In the 19th century, this was the poorest and most desperate area of ​​the East End of London, sunk into degradation due to the decline of the textile industry.
              At the end of the 19th century, Spitalfields boasted the highest crime rate, especially murder and prostitution, in the city, and in 1881 the police force itself denounced it as "the most dangerous area of ​​the metropolis".
              The very slow recovery began only during the 20th century, and even today it remains one of the least developed neighborhoods in London.
              In The Mystery of Virginia Hayley Spitalfields, and in particular the surrounding neighborhoods, will be the scene of disturbing investigative investigations.

            Founded in 1540 as a marketplace, over the centuries it became a real attraction, thanks to the construction of theaters, cafes and nightclubs (unsavory dives, at the time).
            Its decline became evident in the 18th century, when the city's urban boom shifted the interest of Londoners towards more "modern" destinations.
            Many businesses were closed or moved elsewhere, and Covent Garden survived only as a fruit and vegetable market, earning the unfortunate reputation of "Venus Square", where everything was allowed, and every type of business, legal or not, was conducted in broad daylight.
            The rebirth occurred in the first half of the 19th century. The "old Covent Garden" was swept away, demolished and cleaned up. In its place was built the characteristic neoclassical-style covered structure, a symbol, among other things, of popular Victorian London that is often depicted in costume films or genre works.
